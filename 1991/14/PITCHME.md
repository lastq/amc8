Several students are competing in a series of three races. A student earns $5$ points for winning a race, $3$ points for finishing second and $1$ point for finishing third. There are no ties. What is the smallest number of points that a student must earn in the three races to be guaranteed of earning more points than any other student?

---

Know you must win at least one race:
If you don't win at least one race, the oponent could win all three and you would have no chance to beat them.

---

Scenario where the oponent wins the other two races:
Have a scenario where the oponent wins the other two races, therefore they have 10 points, what is the minimum number of points required to beat 10?

---

Come 2nd in the next 2 races:
$The minimum number of extra points required to be greater than 10 as a whole is 6, as 5 + 6 = 11 as such you must win second in the next two races.
