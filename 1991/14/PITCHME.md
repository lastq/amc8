Several students are competing in a series of three races. A student earns $5$ points for winning a race, $3$ points for finishing second and $1$ point for finishing third. There are no ties. What is the smallest number of points that a student must earn in the three races to be guaranteed of earning more points than any other student?

- <font size=3>Know you must win at least one race: If you don't win at least one race, the oponent could win all three and you would have no chance to beat them.</font> |
- <font size=3>Scenario where the oponent wins the other two races: Have a scenario where the oponent wins the other two races, therefore they have 10 points, what is the minimum number of points required to beat 10?</font> |
- <font size=3>Come 2nd in the next 2 races: $The minimum number of extra points required to be greater than 10 as a whole is 6, as 5 + 6 = 11 as such you must win second in the next two races.</font> |
