Several students are competing in a series of three races. A student earns $5$ points for winning a race, $3$ points for finishing second and $1$ point for finishing third. There are no ties. What is the smallest number of points that a student must earn in the three races to be guaranteed of earning more points than any other student?

- Must win at least one race. |
- Oponent wins the other two races then they have 10 points. |
- You must win second in the next two races. |

Notes:
1. Mmust win at least one race: Otherwise he oponent could win all three then you have no chance.
2. Oponent wins the other two races then they have 10 points, what is the minimum number of points required to beat 10?
3. Come 2nd in the next 2 races: The minimum number of extra points required to be greater than 10 as a whole is 6, as 5 + 6 = 11 as such you must win second in the next two races.
